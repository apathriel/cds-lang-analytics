# 🌎 Evaluating environmental impact with Codecarbon

## 📈 Data
the data is based on the exam portfolio

## 📂 Project structure

## ⚙️ Setup
To set up the project, you need to create a virtual environment and install the required packages. You can do this by running the appropriate setup script for your operating system.

### 🐍 Dependencies
Please ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- **Python**: `version 3.12.3`

### 💾 Installation
1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/apathriel/cds-lang-analytics
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd assignment
cd environmental_impact_analysis
```
3. Run the setup script to install dependencies, depending on OS.
```sh
bash setup_unix.sh
```

4. Activate virtual environment (OS-specific) and run main py scripts.
```sh
source env/bin/activate
python src/generate_visualizations.py
```
