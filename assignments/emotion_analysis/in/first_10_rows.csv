2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You should be the Hand of the king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"You can always say no, Ned."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maester luwin,I'm told he drinks all night.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"In any case, candles."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,theon greyjoy,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,But he's coming right now! Down our road!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,I promise.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,D'you know what?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,What?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Move!

2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Where's the Imp?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Will you shut up?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,Arya.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,arya stark,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Would you please shut up.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,My queen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,My queen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Ned.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Tell me about Jon Arryn.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,We both did.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Aye.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I'm not worthy of the honor.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I did hear something about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,And the other brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,The queen has two brothers?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,I hear they call him the Imp.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,I hear he hates that nickname.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Clever girl.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,"We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Have you?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The gods gave me one blessing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Don't get up.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,ros,M'lord.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Close the door!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,She belonged with me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"In my dreams, I kill him every night."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Not all of them.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Daenerys!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,No.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,maid,"It's too hot, my lady."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Where is he?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Come forward, my dear."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Where's he going?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,The ceremony is over.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When will they be married?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Is it true they lie with their horses?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Do you take me for a fool?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,I don't know.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,"We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,He's so handsome.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,Sansa…
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Is he dead yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Uncle Benjen!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,So take me with you when you go back.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Jon…
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,The Wall isn't going anywhere.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,I'm ready to swear your oath.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,I don't care about that.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What're you doing back there?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jon snow,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,"Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,The two he was with are still missing.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,A wildling ambush.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Winter is coming.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,Uncle Benjen.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,benjen,Robb boy. How are ye?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,I'm good.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Yes. Lovely country.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,You're tall. Still growing?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"I think so, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And have you bled yet?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,"No, Your Grace."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,And your dress. Did you make it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Such talent. You must make something for me.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I hear the same.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Your pardon.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I don't fight in tournaments.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,No? Getting a little old for it?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Well said.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sansa stark,Arya!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robb stark,Time for bed.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,I won't let him take you.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,How did he get so fat?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,a voice,"It's Maester Luwin, my lord."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Send him in.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,Stay.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,What news?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,"The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,catelyn stark,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,luwin,A different time. Different king.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,When?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,When their omens favor war.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,illyrio,"Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, Magister."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,"She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jorah mormont,There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,viserys,Make him happy.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,khal drogo,No.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,Do you know the Common Tongue?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,daenerys targaryen,Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,"Rough night, Imp?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,I didn't pick you for a hunter.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,tyrion lannister,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,sandor clegane,It's not hunting if you pay for it.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,"No, but I'm still better than you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,eddard stark,I hope I'll serve you well.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,robert baratheon,"You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,"Come on, you."
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,Stop. STOP.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Are you completely mad?
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,It's all right. It's all right.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,cersei lannister,He saw us!
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,"I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,bran stark,Ten
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,Ten.
2011-04-17,Season 1,Episode 1,Winter is Coming,jaime lannister,The things I do for love.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"You need to drink, child... And eat."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Isn't there anything else?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Khaleesi!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,Your hands.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,"As you wish, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jorah mormont,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,viserys targaryen,"Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,What good will my sympathies do them?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,One word and I'll hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,I'm telling mother!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,You can't...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Do you understand?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Little brother.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Beloved siblings.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,myrcella baratheon,Is Bran going to die?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Apparently not.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,The Maester says the boy may live.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Please.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I never knew.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I am grateful..
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,A sword for the wall?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I already have one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Of course I have.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Soon enough.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jaime lannister,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It's good you've got help.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Impressive.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,A present?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,It's so skinny.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I can be quick.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I think so.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,First lesson
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I know which end to use.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,You've said it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I want you to leave.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I have no choice.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You can. You must.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,You Starks are hard to kill.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,My mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,She was very kind.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,It was always my color.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Farewell, Snow."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"And you, Stark."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I've half a mind to go with you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You should have asked me 20 years ago.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,I recall a few chances.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Bessie. She was one of yours.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Wylla.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Nor will I.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,She's little more than a child.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Tell me we're not speaking of this.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Why do you read so much?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Is this a trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,Until your brother killed that King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jon snow,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,tyrion lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Talk to Poole about it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't care about appointments!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,When was the last time you left this room?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I have to take care of him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,assassin,You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,No!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever seen a dragon?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,"Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Everywhere? Even in the east?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jhiqui,It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,The moon?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,irri,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,How old were you?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Nine?!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Yes.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Will it take three years?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,No.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,benjen stark,Welcome.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,The boy was always sure-footed before.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,theon greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,maester luwin,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,I'll ride to King's Landing.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,"Mother, you can't."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I must.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,rodrick cassel,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robb stark,What about Bran?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,catelyn stark,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,Finish a man?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,doreah,"If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,daenerys targaryen,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Pardon me, Ser."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,"Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,I'll get you!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,Arya!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,What are you doing here? Go away.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"Mycah, my Lord."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,He the butcher's boy.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,He's my friend.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,mycah,"It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Stop it!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Arya, stay out of this."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,"I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Nymeria!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Please don't.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Then go! Don't touch me.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,It's a direwolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,I'll check down here.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,I think I heard a noise.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Go!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Where is she?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,She's been taken directly before the King.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Who took her?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,The Lannisters found her.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Right, get back."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,jory cassel,The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Back! Back to the inn. All back!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,I'm sorry.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Are you hurt?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,No.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,That's not what happened!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,joffrey lannister,Shut up!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,In bed asleep.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar! Liar liar liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Stop it! That's enough of that.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Liar liar liar!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,Stop! Arya!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,"What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"Gladly, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,I'd forgot the damned wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,So be it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,We have another wolf.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,As you will.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,You can't mean it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,robert baratheon,A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,arya stark,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sansa stark,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,s this your command... your Grace?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Where is the beast?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,soldier,"Chained up outside, your Grace."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,"No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,cersei lannister,Is this some trick?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,eddard stark,The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
2011-04-24,Season 1,Episode 2,The Kingsroad,sandor clegane,He ran... Not very fast.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings landing guard,"Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jory cassel,"Yes, my Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,kings landing guard,If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,But you just stood there and watched.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"You served him well, when serving was safe."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lord Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Lord Varys.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Grand Maester.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,How many years has it been? You were a young man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,And you served another King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Without the King?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Mmm, how much?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,Can the treasury bear such expense?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,How could you let this happen?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,renly baratheon,"Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,It's ugly.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,Do I have to marry her?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,I don't want to.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How would you handle them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,A royal army?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if the northerners rebel?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,For me. I'm their King.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,I'm not asking.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,joffrey lannister,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I'm practicing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,Practicing for what?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,The Prince.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,"Arya, stop!"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,The Hound killed your friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,You're an idiot.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,Enough!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,What's happening here?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,sansa stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,septa mordane,You've barely eaten a thing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,It's all right. Go on.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,War was easier than daughters.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Go away!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Mine.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Come here. Now what do you want with this?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,It's called Needle.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,laughs] That's the essence of it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,So was I! He is a liar.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Winter is coming.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I don't hate her. Not really.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I can keep it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,I hate your stories.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,What are you telling him now?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,old nan,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,Maybe we do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,"I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robb stark,Don't ever say that.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,bran stark,I'd rather be dead.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick cassel,"Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rodrick cassel,My Lady.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,guard,"Follow me, Lady Stark."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,A dear friend told me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,Lady Stark.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Lord Varys.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Do you know whose dagger this is?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,varys,I must admit I do not.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Yours?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,To whom?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,Next!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,alliser thorne,"Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,A charming man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Good news or bad?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Both.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grand maester pycelle,Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,My wife is in Winterfell.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Is she?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,You're a funny man. A very funny man.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"You broke my nose, bastard!"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,It's an improvement.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,pyp,I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"What're you looking at, halfman?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rast,What do you care about our faces?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,grenn,"We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,We have proof. We have the blade.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,How could you be so stupid?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Calm down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Then what are you raving about?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And my husband?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,Let me go.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,Never.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,I wish I could see the girls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,It's too dangerous.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Just for a moment.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Until we know who our enemies are...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,cersei lannister,And if you find the proof?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,"Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,He still loves you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,catelyn stark,Does he?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,eddard stark,Off with you.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"Of course, your Grace."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Who was it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,How'd you do it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,Lance through the heart.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel lannister,"It's empty, your Grace."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What do you mean it's empty?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,lancel lannister,There's no more wine.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,"Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,barristan selmy,"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,Your outlaw... Any last words?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"I cut his head off, so no."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,robert baratheon,What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jaime lannister,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,From whom?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Tell them all to stop.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Until I command them otherwise.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,You're learning to talk like a Queen.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys targaryen,You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,No!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,viserys targaryen,Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,You walk. [to Viserys]
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,You're leaving?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,What kind of reports?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,The kind I don't want to believe.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,m ready. I won't let you down.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,But I'm better than every...
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,A bear's balls.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,You're joking?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,And how do a bear's balls taste?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,Call me what you like.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,benjen stark,"Enjoy the capital, brother."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,I always do.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,yoren,"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Armor.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Slow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,Slow.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,There are no rabbits.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,"Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rakharo,A blessing from the Great Stallion.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,irri,She does not want to eat horse.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,rhakaro,We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jorah mormont,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Eight... no, nine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,All of them brief?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,"We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jeor mormont,Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,maester aemon,"When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,It's a boy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,khal drogo,How do you know?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,daenerys targaryen,I know.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,Of course.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,He'll never walk again.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,tyrion lannister,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,jon snow,"Farewell, My Lord."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,Who are you?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,It's too heavy.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,What if I drop it?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,I'm a girl.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,arya stark,A needle.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,syrio forel,"Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",old nan,The little Lordo s been dreaming again.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We have visitors.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I don't want to see anyone.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I don't want to go.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester luwin,He has no memory of that day.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Curious.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Why are you here?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,"Kneel, Hodor."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,"Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",maester luwin,The boy has lost the use of his legs.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,I'm not a cripple.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bran stark,Will I really be able to ride?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robb stark,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,He's not my master.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,She wasn't feeling well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,My lady's whereabouts...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,Must have been a pretty sight.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",theon greyjoy,"Careful, Imp."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,What in seven hells is that?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,Tell them your name.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rast,Come to take the black pudding.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"I yield. Please, no more."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Enough! He yielded.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Are you sure you want to do this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Well fought!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Piss off.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Did he hurt you?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I've had worse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Why didn't you get up and fight?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Why not?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,But if they did?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,And you know these men?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,You sold slaves.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Aye.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Why?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,I had no money and an expensive wife.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,And where is she now?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,They do.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,You have dragon's blood in your veins?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,It's entirely possible.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,Really? Why dragons?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I was not locked in. I have seen things.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,What have you seen?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,A pirate ship?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,A dragon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,What happened to the skulls?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,That's very sad.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,I wouldn't worry about that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,But what if?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,And everyone would hate me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Nobody could ever hate you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Joffrey does.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Please shut up about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Why were they killed?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,You should speak to your father about these matters.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",janos slynt,"Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",varys,Dreadful.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Why?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did Jon want the night before he died?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,He came inquiring after a book.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,A book? What book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I'd like to read it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,Such a tragedy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,What else could it be?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Poison.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Everybody knows that.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grand maester pycelle,"Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,He's right about that.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.

The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Varys or the Queen?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"As you can see, I'm busy."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",hugh of vale,"I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Let them look.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did Lord Arryn want?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,He always came to see the boy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,I'd like to see him as well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,This is fine work.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,It's not for sale.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,I made it for me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tobho mott,"Forgive him, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What kind of questions?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Your mother?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,"Who she was, what she looked like."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What did you tell him?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",gendry baratheon,She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Find anything?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,King Robert's bastard son.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,This is for the King from Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Three? Four?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"Forgive me, my Lord..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"We've met before, you know."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,That's where you got your scar?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,Vicious sons of whores.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,They like their bloodshed.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Theon? He's a good lad.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jaime lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,Where have you been?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Watch duty. With Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,He wasn't hungry.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",pyp,Impossible!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rast,"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,No one touches Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",grenn,"Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",doreah,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",irri,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Why did you hit her?!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,What's this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Please.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,This stinks of manure. All of it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,Stop - stop it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You do not talk back to me!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",viserys targaryen,You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I wouldn't doubt it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I find that hard to believe.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I know where to put it.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,What color hair?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Red.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I like red hair. And her... Her...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,You don't want to know.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,That good?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,Better.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,What's my name?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Jon Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,And why is my surname Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,So... You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,It is a bit nippy.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jon snow,I build my own fires.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",alliser thorne,"That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,He is still the true King.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,The truth now
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jorah mormont,Home.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",daenerys targaryen,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Lover's quarrel?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,I'm sorry. Do I...?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",arya stark,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,Arya!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",septa mordane,Don't be rude!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,"Gods, who is that?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,And his opponent?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",robert baratheon,"Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sansa stark,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",jory cassel,"My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Your Grace.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,You're missing your tournament.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,She likes it here.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,What are you doing here?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",eddard stark,"The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",cersei lannister,As was I.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",rodrick cassel,I'd rather throw myself down a well.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",marillion,"Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",bronn,You can have my room.

2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house whent,She is.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",catelyn stark,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",knight of house bracken,Our lord is honored by his trust.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",tyrion lannister,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He'd never worn this armor before.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who determines the draw?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,"He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Yes. That will never happen.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,barristan selmy,Robert tends to do what he wants.

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're too fat for your armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Oh, it's funny, is it?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lancel lannister,"No, Your Grace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No? You don't like the Hando s joke?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're torturing the poor boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,The breastplate stretcher?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long before he figures it out?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Maybe you should have one invented.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And who's going to hit you back?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Aye.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I'm not thirsty.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Your squire... A Lannister boy?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Robert?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,I'll take that bet.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Or you could even buy a friend.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,He's going to die.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Ser Loras rides well.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sansa stark,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Stop this madness in the name of your King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"I owe you my life, Ser."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,sandor clegane,I'm no Ser.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Remove his hood.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,marillion,"On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,I did... often and loudly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,And why would I do that?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,Should I gag him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,"My Lady, this way."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,rodrik cassel,"I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm willing if she is."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,Family comes first?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,"How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bran stark,And then she left!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,maester luwin,"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."

2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Why should I be jealous?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Might surprise you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Hmm?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,You are jealous.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,And what about the Starks?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,You're a very serious boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I'm not a boy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,"Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,theon greyjoy,I don't want to pay for it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,ros,Then get yourself a wife.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"How is your son, my Lord?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He'll never walk again.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,But his mind is sound?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,So they say.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I didn't trust you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,So why do you trust me now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What sort of doom does the King face?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who gave it to him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Someone who could afford it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He started asking questions.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,"What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,This Hand is not the other.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,illyrio mopatis,It never was.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You do move quietly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,We all have our qualities.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Strictly speaking.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Saw me with your own eyes?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Eyes I own.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,One shudders at the thought.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Oh.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Have you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Was that you under the bed?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"Oh, please."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To a small council meeting?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,Off with you. No begging.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I want to see my father.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,guard,"You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,They said they were going to kill you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Who did?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Oh, Arya."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Where did you hear this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What were you doing in the dungeons?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,Chasing a cat.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Your name, friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,I'm a girl!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Did Benjen send you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Know what?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"Best said in private, my Lord."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Go on. We'll talk more later.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"Jory, take her safely to her room."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,How many guards does my father have?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,arya stark,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"No fear on that count, little Lady."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Well?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,yoren,"It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"You're far from home, Lady Stark."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,To whom do I speak?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,There was no time to send word.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,He doesn't look like a prisoner.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,My sister will decide what he looks like.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,vardis egen,"Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,bronn,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,I like you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I need to see the King first -- alone.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Is it about my wife?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,steward,"No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,The whore is pregnant.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You're speaking of murdering a child.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Then we're no better than the Mad King.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Careful, Ned. Careful now."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Based on whose information?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,varys,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,grand maester pycelle,"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,We should have had them both killed years ago.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,She dies.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I will have no part in it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What can I do for you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,When do you return to Winterfell?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Why? What do you care?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I don't have the time.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,Heward and Wyl.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Find them and meet me at the stables.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,Mommy? Is that the bad man?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,It is.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,He's little.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,tyrion lannister,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,"You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robin arryn,Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Perhaps you will, my little love."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,catelyn stark,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,lysa arryn,"Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mord,"You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,You're jealous.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Are you sure this won't hurt?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Only if I slip.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,And you prefer me like this?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Mhmm.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,I want you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Hold still.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Everywhere?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,I have an outrageous amount of money.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Not as much as the Lannisters.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,But a lot more than you.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,"Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Hmm... How did that ever happen?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Do you know who should be King?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Be serious.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,I'm fourth in line.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,Stannis?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,He's still my older brother.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,What are you doing?!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,Look at it.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,renly baratheon,You cut me!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,loras tyrell,"You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Is my father wrong?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,We still outnumber them.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Five.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What do you want?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Our marriage.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,Every day.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,How long can hate hold a thing together?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"Yes, it is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,So why now?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,"You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,I know.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,robert baratheon,No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,cersei lannister,It doesn't make me feel anything.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I will.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,mhaegen,"He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,How many?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Come.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,Jory!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,My Lord.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,Such a small pack of wolves.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,"Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,I remember him well.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jory cassel,If you threaten my Lord again...
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,eddard stark,"You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,jaime lannister,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Your pardon, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,Do you know what your wife has done?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,She did nothing I did not command.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Who'd have thought she had it in her?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,I am the King's Hand -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,You were the King's Hand!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,trying to keep the peace -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,You shall now be held accountable.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,He butchered my men.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,I took you for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Hold your tongue.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,cersei lannister,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,If we don't act… there will be a war.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!"

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,The hunt?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,The Targaryen girl -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,When are you gonna tell him?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Not now.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You're talking about war.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I'm talking about justice.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,"And it's not your duty, because it's not your House."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Where's Bran?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I don't know. It's not my House.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,Robb?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,All alone in the deep dark woods.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,"Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"I can't. The saddle, the straps."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,Robb!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,wildling,Shut up! Drop the blade!

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Are you all right?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bran stark,"Yes, it doesn't hurt."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,You don't have the right -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,What about her?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,osha,"Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robb stark,We'll keep her alive.

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Dwarf man still making noise.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,No gold!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Well, I don't have it here."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,No gold! Fuck off.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,I don't want to practice today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,No?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,You are troubled.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Yes -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,I don't like dolls and k -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,"More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,The old and the new.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,syrio forel,There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She's doing well.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,She'll never keep it down.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Tell me what she is saying.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She's going to have a boy.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,They love her.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,She truly is a queen today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,It's not my law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,They don't belong to you.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Whatever is hers is also mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"Once, perhaps."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,And you have all three.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,"You can go, but you can't have the eggs."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,It means everything to me.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,And yet here you stand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,And here I stand.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Noise again!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,About the gold -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,Where?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,You want free? Go be free.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mord,What message?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You wish to confess your crimes?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,Silence!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,What happened next?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,What do you think you're doing?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Confessing my crimes.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,catelyn stark,"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,I understand the law.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,"You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You have that right.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,"My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,"I'll fight for you, my Lady."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,It'll be my honor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,knight,The honor should be mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Make the bad man fly!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ser vardis,"With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Agreed.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You demanded a trial by combat.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ser vardis,"My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,"Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,The trial will be today.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Do I have a volunteer?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Anyone?... Anyone?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bronn,I'll stand for the dwarf.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lancel lannister,"More wine, your Grace?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Oh, what was I saying?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,A simpler time.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,barriston,"It was, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,Sounds exhilarating.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,"Once, I think."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,Those were some lucky girls.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,barristan selmy,"I don't believe so, your Grace."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,Those were the days!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,"What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robert baratheon,"Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,renly baratheon,I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"Brigands, most likely."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,man,"None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,"If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,Wel…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,beric dondarrion,As you command.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Grand Maester Pycelle.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,grand maester pycelle,My Lord.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Is it over?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,lysa arryn,You don't fight with honor!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,bronn,No. He did.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,robin arryn,Can I make the little man fly now?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,tyrion lannister,A Lannister always pays his debts.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,My mother isn't from the North.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,I'm aware of that.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Yes. I have hair.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,I've never seen it.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Would you like to?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,I come from a very small village in -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Sansa -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Septa.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,Now you are being rude.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,mordane,My prince.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,My prince.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,"You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,There's nothing to forgive.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,joffrey lannister,"You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,Going to King's Landing.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,In a turnip cart?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,And you can afford that?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,Some of my friends are more generous than others.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I'll have lots of company…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,"And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,Don't be a fool.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,"I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,See what?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,theon greyjoy,I'm going to miss you!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,ros,I know.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,What?!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,Listen -
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,What about Joffrey?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,What? No.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"Please, Father. Please don't."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Can't we take Syrio back with us?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Seven hells.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,"I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,"The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,eddard stark,"Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,Wait!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,arya stark,Come on!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,sansa stark,It's not fair!

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,That is no place for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,khal drogo,You are no king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Keep away from me!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,"Viserys, please."

2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,What's he saying?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,"He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Look away Khaleesi.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,No.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,"No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!"
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,viserys targaryen,Dany please!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,khal drogo,A crown for a king.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,jorah mormont,Khaleesi…
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,daenerys targaryen,He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Attacking him was stupid.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Lannisters don't act like fools.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Catelyn Stark took my brother.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Why is he still alive?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Ned Stark.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,"One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,It wouldn't have been clean.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Clean...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Now that's what you want people to think of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,It's the truth.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,Of course it bothers me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jaime lannister,So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,"No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tywin lannister,Hmm.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You're in pain.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"I've had worse, my lady."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Perhaps it's time to go home.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Has he done this before?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Jaime would have killed him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Your brother Or your lover?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,My son saw you with him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Do you love your children?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,No more than I love mine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,And they are all Jaime's.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Thank the Gods.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You've always hated him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,Hated him? I worshiped him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Oh, but it was."

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,"Yes, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,"Why don't you join us, My Lord?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I'm saving myself for another.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,A stupid saying.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,She must be very beautiful.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,I do believe my lordo s in love.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,For many years. Most of my life really.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,ros,And what do you want?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,Where is it you come from?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,And what's that?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I will be lord after my father.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,So you're not lord now?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I'm not a Southerner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what ""impunent"" means."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,theon greyjoy,I thought she was our prisoner.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm used to worse than him.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Why did you come here?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Why? What are you afraid of?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,Owls and Shadowcats and...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester luwin,"The ""things"" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,osha,"They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I miss girls.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Why is he alone?

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"Robert, my sweet..."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"Out, all of you!"

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,Give it to the council after I'm dead.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I will.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,"And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,robert baratheon,My memory.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Give him milk of the poppy.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,barristan selmy,He was reeling from the wine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,No man could have protected him from himself.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,barristan selmy,"His squire, from the king's own skin."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,His squire? The Lannister boy?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,lord varys,I'm afraid those birds have flown.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Not dirt. Lands.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"Lands, yes..."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,It's not a chair. It's a...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Can't you help me make him understand?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,And because he had dragons.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,You don't believe it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report."

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,Princess.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,That? Dornish swill.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"You honor me, Ser."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,The honor...the honor is all mine.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Is something wrong?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,I have a thirst. Open it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Open it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Pour.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,Do as he says.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,As the princess commands.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,"Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,You first.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,wine merchant,Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,You will drink.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,doreah,Khaleesi! Stop him!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jorah mormont,Come.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jeor mormont,You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,Do you take me for a servant?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,May I go?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,maester aemon,As you wish.

2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,pypar,Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,pypar,You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,jon snow,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I always wanted to be a Wizard.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,She won't care.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,And what should I do with a hundred swords?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,What about Stannis?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Stannis is your older brother.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,renly baratheon,"Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tell me something,Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,tomard,"Yes, My Lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Now leave us.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,My Lord protector.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The King has no true born sons.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So when the King dies...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it would seem. Unless...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"There is no ""unless""."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Do you have a shred of honor?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,We?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,What you suggest is treason.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Only if we lose.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy.."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,No. I won't do it.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it will be Stannis and war?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,There is no other choice. He is the heir.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,You promised Catelyn you would help me.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,daenerys targaryen,He will not have my son.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,khal drogo,"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,king joffrey,Liar!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,cersei lannister,You think he stands alone?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,king joffrey,"Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,janos slynt,Men of the Watch!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,eddard stark,I want no bloodshed.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Now!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I did warn you not to trust me.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,"Yah! Left high, left low."

2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,septa mordane,Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sansa stark,She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,septa mordane,Hush! Go back to your room.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sansa stark,What is it? What's happening?
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,septa mordane,Do as I told you. Run!
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,"This way! Left, right."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,arya stark,"You said right, but you went left."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,And now you are a dead girl.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,arya stark,Only 'cause you lied.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,My tongue lied.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,arya stark,"I was so. I watched, but you..."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,syrio forel,"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,meryn trant,"Arya Stark, come with us."

2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Robb? He's just a boy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddard stark,You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,varys,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Have my horse saddled and ready.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l agree. l'll go.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,everyone,You can't!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,Unless there was a profit in it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stevron frey,"Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,ryger rivers,"Father, please –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,ls there somewhere we can talk?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l'm sure she will give you many sons.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"He is quite ill, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"My lord, l –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l'm sure there were reasons –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,Why should l let him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,You swore an oath to my father.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Why don't you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,walder frey,"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,voices outside,And engage!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"Soon, he says."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,This is Valyrian steel.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jeor mormont,"No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,unidentified nights watchers,Well done. Well done.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,nights watcher,"You earned that, Snow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,nights watcher,Well done.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,"Go on, let's have a look."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,At what?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,The sword! Show us the sword.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,all,Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,Let's have a look.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,Piss off.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,pyp,"Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grenn,Look at its eyes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,What is it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l - l can't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,You can't what?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l'm really not supposed to say.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,What? What about him?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,l should be there. l should be with him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,"lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Well? What did he say?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Huh.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,What does he want in return?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"Fine, fine. And?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,She won't be happy about that. And?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,l did.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,And?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,One was – Do you consent?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Can l refuse?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Not if you want to cross.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Then l consent.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Sam said you wanted to see me?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Sam told you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jon snow,You're Aemon Targaryen.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,maester aemon,"l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,khal drogo,My horse…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cohollo,Blood of my blood…
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,khal drogo,"No, l must ride."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"You do not command me, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,Hyah! Hyah!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Shagga likes axes.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kevan lannister,They do seem rather ferocious.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l took her.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Took her? From whom?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,He said something.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Who are you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,prostitute,Who would you like me to be?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,prostitute,Shae. What did your mother call you?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,My mother died giving birth to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What sort of accent is that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Foreign.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,For-
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What do you want from me?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,And what do l get?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Who told you this? Women you paid?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Let's start with your last night in this world.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l won't leave him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,The wound has festered.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"You did this, witch."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,"The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,l think you're right.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,You've saved me once more.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,And now you must save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Do it. Save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,There is a price.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"You'll have gold, whatever you want."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,My death?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,"No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,"Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Kill her and you kill your khal.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,Go. Now.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Take her and leave. Take her!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,mirri maz duur,"You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,No one will enter.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,Bring him back to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,l have to save him.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,This must not be.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,This must be.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,qotho,Witch.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,Nothing good will come of this.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,"No, you can't."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,irri,Khaleesi!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,"No further, horselord."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Are you hurt?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,The baby –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Hmm?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,daenerys targaryen,is coming.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,Fetch the midwives.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,They will not come. They say she is cursed.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jorah mormont,They'll come or l'll have their heads.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rakharo,The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Are you in agony, my lion?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,No.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Just used to it.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Drink.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Let's play a new game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Not if you win.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What are you good at?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l happen to be a great judge of character.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,This sounds like a boring game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't want to play this game.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,But my mother hit harder.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You killed your first man before you were 12.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You've been north of the Wall.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,What brought you up there?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Work.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't want to play.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Drink.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And we've established the rules about lying?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Drink!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Are you sure –
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,My turn.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Who were you in love with?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,That's not how the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,l don't care the way the game works.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Our lord here used to be married.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Married?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did you hear that?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Another night, perhaps."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,Not another night. This night.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's not a pleasant story.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,"Oh, maybe l will cry."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You should have known she was a whore.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"As l said, l was young and stupid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You are still young and stupid.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What is it? What do you want?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're sleeping through the war.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,What?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Get my squire!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You don't have a squire.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"lf l die, weep for me."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,shae,You'll be dead. How will you know?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'll know.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister soldier,Watch out! Move!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,lannister soldier,Out of the way! Move aside!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,Stay low.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Stay low?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tribesmen of vale,Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,To battle!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're a shit warrior.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,l'm alive?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,You're alive.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Did we win?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,How did our tribesmen do?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,bronn,"Yeah, good."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,lt's nice to see them getting along.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,You're wounded.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,He wasn't here.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,Where was he?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tywin lannister,"With his other 18,000 men."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,tyrion lannister,And where are they?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rodrik cassel,"We should go, my lady."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,No!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,rodrik cassel,My lady!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,stark bannermen,Hyah! Hyah!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,He's more use to us alive than dead.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,catelyn stark,Take him away and put him in irons.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,jaime lannister,"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,greatjon umber,"Come on, pretty man."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,"l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,theon greyjoy,The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,robb stark,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,Three coppers.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,How about a nice fat pigeon?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,"Oh, piss off now. Go on."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,kings landing baker,Piss off!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,street urchin,They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,arya stark,Who?
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,street urchin,The Hand of the King.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Traitor! Coward!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddark stark,Baelor!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Traitor! Traitor!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,eddark stark,"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,grand maester pycelle,"As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,joffrey lannister,"My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sansa stark,"No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,cersei lannister,"My son, this is madness."
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,populace,Put him down!
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,yoren,Don't look!

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jonos bracken,The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,robb stark,Renly is not the king.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,robb stark,"That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jonos bracken,Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,galbart glover,Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,greatjon umber,"My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,rickard karstark,l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,catelyn stark,Because of men like you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,There are no men like me. Only me.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,I hoped the fall would kill him.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,jaime lannister,You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lancel lannister,"l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,cersei lannister,Stop talking. Get back into bed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,They have my son.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,kevan lannister,"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,kevan lannister,l'm told we still have his sisters.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tyrion lannister,And do what?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,tywin lannister,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,mirri maz duur,"Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,daenerys targaryen,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.

Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,grand maester pycelle,"He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern.

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,varys,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?

And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."

2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Maybe he's a little squire.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,hot pie,He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,lommy greenhands,Let's have a look.

A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but in his absence…"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,I tried to stop it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Robb Stark is a child.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What do you know about warfare?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,Joffrey is King.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,You are here to advise him.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,How?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,One.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,One?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,tyrion lannister,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,"Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,"Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,Of course I remember!
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord,I - I believe it will.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,"We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,luwin,Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,portan,"My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,Don't have any pain.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Lucky for you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,That way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,You've been having those dreams again.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I don't dream.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,Everyone dreams.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,osha,"The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,bran stark,The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,doreah,"What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,He said they ate meat.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,doreah,He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,I remember.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,Does it ever end?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,And you're sure there's no other way?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,No one will take my dragons.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jorah mormont,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,As you are mine.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,"What do we seek, Khaleesi?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,"Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,"I will not fail you, blood of my blood."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,daenerys targaryen,You never have.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,rakharo,This is… bad time to start.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,Having a rough time of it?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Nothing's killed me yet.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,Your ass killed the sledge.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,You offered me a ride!
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,"I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Are those girls?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,Craster's daughters.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,"What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?"

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,grenn,It's beyond foul.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,edd,All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,What happens to the boys?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam,Hmm?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,We're not Southerners.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,jon snow,Jon Snow.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,The lad meant no harm.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,"No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,You bring any of that good wine with you?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"I could tell you, but I'm thirsty."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,"He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,Give it here.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,And where does he plan marching this army?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,gilly,This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,We chose different paths.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,lord mormont,A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,craster,"Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Curious.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Yes.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,And which truth is that?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Knowledge is power.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,alton,"These are... Your Grace, these are..."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"A word, Your Grace?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Of course they are.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,theon greyjoy,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,You can't go to Winterfell.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I beg your pardon?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,Why in the name of all the Gods -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,I will ride at first light.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."

2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,robb stark,Give Lord Renly my regards.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,catelyn stark,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What is all this?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We can't find Arya Stark.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,"With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,His life is in danger.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,joffrey lannister,I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,catelyn stark,He is not trustworthy!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,joffrey lannister,I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,joffrey lannister,How many bastards does he have running around?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Where is the bastard?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,blacksmith,The Night's Watch! Heading North!

2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jaqen hghar,Lovely boy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What do you want?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jaqen hghar,A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I have friends.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,rorge,Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jaqen hghar,"A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. . You're called Arry. . This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,rorge,"Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,You should have asked nicely.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,rorge,Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jaqen hghar,The boy has more courage than sense.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,rorge,Come here!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,They don't scare me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,What are you doing?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,They're looking for me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gold cloak,You're in command here?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,You're a long way from home.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gold cloak,I asked you a question.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gold cloak,I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,"It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yoren,We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gold cloak,We're looking for a boy named Gendry. . He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,My lord.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,"You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,It was quite a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,And I tell him the story of how we meet.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How can you tell?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,shae,I can always tell.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I don't like threats.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Who threatened you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,alton,"I will, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,alton,"I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Safe travels, cousin."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,If that's everything?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,pycelle,A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Trouble with the wildlings?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,That's why they're called wildlings.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,pycelle,The northerners are a superstitious people.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,varys,How do you kill a dead man?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Apparently you burn him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,"Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,We fart when we die?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,"My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,We were having a serious discussion.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,Would you look at that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,I prefer watching them come towards me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I'm sure that's nice too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,"Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,You were with her? How many times?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,grenn,"Well, as many times as I could."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,edd,We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. . Get the turnips too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,You shouldn't touch me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,You're very brave.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,What're you doing?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,Sam said you could help.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,What? .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I know it sounds a bit mad.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,Sam we can't take her -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,It's just not possible.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gilly,"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,Why did you do that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"Do what, ask her a question?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,You were cruel.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I didn't touch her!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jon snow,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,You don't need to see this.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,He is blood of my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Who did this?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,jorah mormont,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,irri,No! They killed his soul!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,irri,They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,daenerys targaryen,"And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Is it as you remember my lord?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Looks smaller.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,"Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Who will?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,I love the cold and wet.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Then you'll be king before long.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I don't blame him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,"He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Your place is on this ship.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,woman,Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I haven't paid you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,"I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"I'm sorry, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"No, my lord… It's Mhaegen."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Who?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,roz,"Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,podrick,More wine?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Damn it, boy!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,podrick,"Apologies, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You know your wines, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"That I do. A fine dinner, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Wars have been started for less.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Orders are orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I never said they were the queen's orders.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,You know your sister better than I do.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I don't listen to filth.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,"You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"No, we shan't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Boys?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,janos,I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,To the new Commander.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,bronn,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,"If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I'm not afraid of no battles.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,Two men fighting isn't a battle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,They had armor on.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,So?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,"So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,lommy,"No, it isn't."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,It's when they've got armor on.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Now who told you that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,A knight?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,How'd you know he was a knight?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,"Well, cause he got armor on."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,hot pie,How'd you know?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Cause I sold armor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,No idea.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,You're a liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"Well, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Who asked questions?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Lord Stark.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,What did they ask about?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,My mom.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Who's your mom?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,And who was your father?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I'm not a girl!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,That's true. You're still a girl.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I am not!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,They won't. Not from me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"You were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,arya stark,Do not call me milady.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,gendry baratheon,"As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,What you carrying?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I need to get to Pyke.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,man,I'll find you a horse.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I bet you can.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,None like you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You don't know what I'm like.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Have my things sent up to the castle.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Is that an offer from my future king?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,A man. Your blood and your heir.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Lord Stark is gone.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,And how do you feel about that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Gold.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,My blood is salt and iron.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,He heeds your counsel?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I will lead the attack myself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"Oh, you will?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,My dear.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,Yara?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,"So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,She can't lead an attack!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,And why not?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You're a woman!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,yara greyjoy,You're the one in skirts.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,"This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,all three,What's dead may never die.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,theon greyjoy,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,balon,Who said anything about the Lannisters?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"And yet, they both have larger armies."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Mind your words, pirate. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Matthos.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,That's a promise that always comes true.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,Only the clever ones.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,It is. .
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"One thing, I want the queen."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,The queen?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,As if she would just let you!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,You believe your king can win?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,He is the one true king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,saan,"You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,When will the King have a sail?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,As soon as his God wills it.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Oh you and your mother.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,But you always came home.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,I wasn't praying.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,"Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Don't tell him that.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,tyrion lannister,She was my mother too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,cersei lannister,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,matthos,Your Grace.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,How did it fare with your pirate?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Does seem the wiser choice.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,"At once, Your Grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,davos,Come.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,What did you say to him?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,I told him death by fire is the purest death.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Why?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,Tell your lord to burn them then.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,You must have faith.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,Then we must be the ten.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,You must give... all of yourself.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,I have a wife. I took a vow.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,melisandre,"She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,stannis baratheon,A son?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,"Out, all of you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,This bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,craster,I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Wait outside.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Now!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Leave us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,What did you do?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,What business is that of yours?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,You know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jon snow,I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,"Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,jeor,Don't lose it again.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Gilly.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,You're leaving.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,I can't take it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gilly,"You, you shouldn't give it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam,Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,hodor,Hodor.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,Every night it's the same.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,"I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,So she was lying? They don't exist?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bran stark,"No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,"This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,luwin,All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Loras! Highgarden!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,man,Get him!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,crowd,Oh!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Yield! I yield.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Well fought. Approach.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Rise. Remove your helm.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,colen,"Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,You are most kind.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,Your Grace.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Gerard. How's your foot?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,"Better, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gerard,They don't know their own size is all.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Good man.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Why?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"If you'll follow me, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,catelyn stark,"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,brienne,"I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What are you doing here?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You lying bitch.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Why didn't you tell me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Father.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,I've always wanted a castle.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,And what's my role in all this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I'm to fight fishermen?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,Be careful of their nets.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,"Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,What are our words? Our words?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,We do not sow.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,balon,We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,You gave me away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I have no other family.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yara greyjoy,"Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Keep your voice down.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Again, only temporary."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Scullion? What is a scullion?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Kitchen wench.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,A kitchen wench?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but-"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,I'm the weakness?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's a compliment, my lady."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,How is being a weakness a compliment?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Language can be a bit tricky here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,myrcella,"Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,The princess just spoke to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen lannister,Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,He might.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Would you like that?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tommen lannister,No. I don't think so.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Come in.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Who are you?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,"I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,What are you doing?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,What things?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,You said to brush your-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Not now.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Your chamber pot is empty.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Clean the table.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Yes.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,For whom?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Lady Zuriff.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Lady Zuriff
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,She wasn't in this city.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,"I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,shae,Do you want me to leave?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sansa stark,Just brush my hair.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Please.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Thank you, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Why, yes, of course, my lord."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Matrimony, huh? Yes."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Precisely.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But remember, you must tell no one."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Tell no one what?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Who better?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Harrenhal is cursed.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. Oh. And remember-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,The Queen mustn't know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,That must hurt.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,What? What is it?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Brienne is a very capable warrior.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I'll make it up to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,"No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,And Margaery's a virgin?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,loras,Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,As is your right. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,You look very beautiful.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Thank you, Your Grace."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,It's a lovely gown.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,You certainly don't need it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,"Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,Must be the wine.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Here, let me."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I'm sorry.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Do you want my brother to come in and help?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,renly,I don't know what you're talking about.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,"Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,margaery tyrell,Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Dorne is the safest place for her.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,She'll be a hostage.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,A guest.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"It's done, Cersei."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,You cannot stop it.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,No!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,cersei lannister,Get out! Get out!
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,priest,"Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,I would.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,Kneel.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,"Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,drowned priest,What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Leave me out of your next deception.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Find him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"No, you don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,bronn,"No, I don't."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No, please, please."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,I am your loyal servant.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,The eunuch has spies everywhere.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"No, no, no."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,timett,"There are no goats, halfman."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Well, make do."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,How long have you been spying for my sister?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I don't like his beard.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,What? What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, no. No."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,So you poisoned him?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,No. Never.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Lannister, I always served Lannister."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,pycelle,"Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,For your trouble.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Good. One of my better ideas.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,Depends on the sellsword.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,tyrion lannister,I've decided I don't like riddles.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,varys,"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,I can't sleep.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,I don't like the taste.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,What?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,How do you sleep?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Same as most men, I think."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gendry baratheon,Get up.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,Get up.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Keep out of sight, both of you."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,arya stark,"No, I'm not afraid."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,gendry baratheon,I can fight.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,yoren,"Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,man,"Come on, move, move!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,"If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,If he ever gets out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Loras Tyrell?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,They get spooked by their own shadows.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Shh. Do you hear that?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,No.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,There's something out there.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,"Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,There is something out there.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,"Yeah, don't even try me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Rennick.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,rennick,Do you think I'm an idiot?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,guard,Rennick!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,King in the North!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,men,The King in the North!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I doubt it.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,My father outlawed flaying in the North.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,We're not in the North.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,We're not torturing them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,"The high roado s very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, don't! Don't! Please!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Shhh.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,The rot's set in.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, don't! No, don't!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Shh.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"No, you can't!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You'll die if she doesn't.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,"I don't want to be a cripple, please."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,roose bolton,Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,"Your men are not my men, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,wounded soldier,No! You can't!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,What's your name?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Talisa.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Your last name?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,You want to know what side my family fights on?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That boy lost his foot on your orders.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,They killed my father.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That boy did?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,The family he fights for.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I have no hatred for the lad.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,That should help his foot grow back.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,You're going to kill Joffrey?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,If the gods give me strength.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,And then what?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,So who will?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,I don't know.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,"You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,First we have to win the war.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,You never told me where you're from.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,Volantis.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,robb stark,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,talisa,He was unlucky that you were.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sansa stark,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Killing you would send your brother a message.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Leave her face. I like her pretty.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What is the meaning of this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,meryn,"The kind who serves his king, Imp."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,I'm punishing her.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,meryn,No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sansa stark,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,bronn,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"What are you doing here, dog?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sandor clegane,Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,And? What is it?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,sandor clegane,"Look inside, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Happy nameday, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,My nameday has passed.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,We won't tell if you won't.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,No. Her. Touch her.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Could you hit her?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,My uncle sent you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,"Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,Hmm.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Use this.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Harder.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daisy,"Please, Your Grace."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,ros,"Your Grace, if your uncle finds out"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,"Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Begin.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,joffrey lannister,Harder!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm a practical man.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Just not a loyal one.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I would give priority to my head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,Lord Baelish.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,You seem quite interested in our marriage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"You've never married, have you?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,margaery tyrell,"That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,This isn't your horse.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Qarth?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,"Three days to the east, on the sea."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Will they let us in?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,kovarro,They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,What do you know of this place?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,Go on!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"You, keep moving!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,Bring her about!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,What kind of fire melts stone?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Dragonfire.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,There's dragons here?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,"No, all the dragons are dead."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,What's that smell?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Dead people.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,soldier,Move.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"Please, please, no, no! No."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,woman,"He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,They take someone every day?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Does anyone live?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,How dare you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,You may have heard false reports.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,You betrayed Ned.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"No, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Get out!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Have you lost your mind? Get out!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"You have Arya, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,What do you want?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,You think I keep secrets from my son?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Good faith?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,Get out.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,"Get up, you dogs!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,"That's him, the one who picks."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,The Mountain. What are you doing?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,hot pie,He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,You.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,soldier,"Move, boy! Move!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Is there gold and silver in the village?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I don't know.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Gems?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I didn't see any.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Where is the Brotherhood?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I don't know. Please.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Which of the villagers aided them?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Who?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Who helped him?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"Ganes, the butcher, and his son."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,That's better. You've been very helpful.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,"No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,prisoner,No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,woman,"Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,Polliver. The Mountain.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Can that truly be you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Who else might it be?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,My own.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"Watch yourself, Renly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,That's twice I've warned you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,"Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,catelyn stark,We share a common enemy.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,"Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,renly,Would you believe I loved him once?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,I thought we were welcome.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Horde?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,My name is Daenerys-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"You know me, my lord?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,And what should I call you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice,KING Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,Qarth.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Might we see the dragons?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,I am not a liar.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please be careful."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,daenerys targaryen,"Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,"The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Our decision is final.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,Very well. I invoke soumai.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,spice king,Be it on your head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,xaro,"Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tickler,Is there gold or silver in the village?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,I'm not from the village.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,I don't know what that is.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,man,You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,What's this?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,"We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,"Cells are overflowing, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,polliver,"This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"You, do you have a trade?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,gendry baratheon,"Smith, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,polliver,"What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,arya stark,"Safer to travel, my lord."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tywin lannister,Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,mountain,My lord.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,As I said several times.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,I am a knight!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,It's not my fault!
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,I only meant I did as I was bid.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"No, I think not."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,My lord?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,"Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,But her demands?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,lancel,You will?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Pardon?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,"You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Does he listen?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,I've lived within the law for seventeen-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,stannis baratheon,Cleaner ways don't win wars.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Are you afraid, Onion Knight?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,And which are you?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,"Well, that must be very nice for you."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,Do you love your wife?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,I do.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,Yet you have known other women.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Don't talk about my wife.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,And you will.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,They can't bar our passage.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,davos,Gods protect us.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,melisandre,"There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,You swear it?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,And the wording of this oath?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,And in return for my son's loyalty?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,"When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,renly,Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,No! No.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,Follow me!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,soldier,You'll die for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"No, wait, it wasn't her!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,Inside the king's tent - go
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,Now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I won't leave him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Over there, go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,Not that way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,We need to go home. Loras.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"My lord, my lady."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,Get out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,And you want that privilege for yourself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,There's no time for this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,I will put a sword through his righteous face.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't stay here.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,"He would have been a true king, a good king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,loras,Revenge.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,He was very handsome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"He was, Your Grace."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,"Your Grace."" Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Do you want to be a queen?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,margaery tyrell,No. I want to be the queen.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Killed? By whom?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Really? Who'd have thought?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,She'll be safer in Dorne.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's important that we talk about this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,cersei lannister,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,It's wildfire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,No.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,MThat's a lie right there.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,I'm telling you the truth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The smart money would be on more likely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,She's making wildfire.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,When did she tell you this?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Swear to me on what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,On my life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,But I don't care about your life.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,"In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow..."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,lancel,Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,It will be my pleasure.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,Your Grace.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What is it?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Your Grace, I-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,You've come to lecture me on truth?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,I've come to tell you that what I saw.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I'll hear no more about it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Take a company of men, secure the perimeter."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,When do we sail for King's Landing?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,That's not your concern.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,What do you believe?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,davos,"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,stannis baratheon,"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,girl,I've got it! I've got it!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"So it's that one there at the top, on the right."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,Corruption.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,crowd,Yes!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,protester,"We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,You have to admire his imagination.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,He's talking about you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,What? Demon monkey?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,You don't need to convince me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,Demon monkey.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,"Yeah, come on."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,"Where are we headed, Captain?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,I do. Your captain.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,black lorren,"I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Stop. We yield.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,Congratulations on your first command.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,yara greyjoy,"That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"Come on, I'll take you out."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"Dagmer, your first mate."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,You're not.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dagmer,"The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,theon greyjoy,Take me to my ship.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,amory,Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,"We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,reginald,My wife's in Lannisport.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"Maidenpool, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"House Mooton, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what is their sigil?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,They call him the Young Wolf.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,And do you believe them?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tywin lannister,Fetch that water.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A girl says nothing.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I was always a girl.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I didn't have a choice.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,You did. I did. And here we are.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,Three what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man has said.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,The one who tortures everyone.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,A man needs a name.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,arya stark,I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jaqen hghar,"That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,When will he come?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,The Halfhand does things in his own time.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,My uncle told me stories about him.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,Most of them are true.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jeor,"Well, possible for the Halfhand."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,man,About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,"Before I die, please, stop talking."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,Wildlings?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,"So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,grenn,"But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam,Well I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous edd,I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jon snow,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,dolorous,"EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"Take care, my lord."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My companion takes issue.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,To do what?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,How much do you have?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"My lord, this man is insulting."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,My friend remains unconvinced.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,haylene,"We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bronn,This is a shit idea.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,tyrion lannister,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys. Dracarys.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,"Yes, Khaleesi."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,He loves you.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my friend."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,It is known.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,May he ride forever through the night lands.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,doreah,You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,"She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,irri,You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,It sounds wonderful.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,woman,The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Please excuse me for a moment.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What are they doing?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,Or melt it. Very simple.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,"Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Not even when we leave.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,kovarro,Why not?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,"Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,pyatt pree,"Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,daenerys targaryen,What is the House of the Undying?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,xaro,"It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,You watch over her.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Do I know you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,jorah mormont,Who are you?
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,quaithe,"I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,It looked like Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,In the shape of Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Will you stay there long, my lady?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I never knew my mother.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I'm sorry.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,It's a bloody business.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,What comes after is even harder.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,You mean to kill Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I swore a vow.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,I only held him that once as he was dying.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,brienne,"Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,catelyn stark,I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,winterfell shepherd,"And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,winterfell shepherd,"My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,"Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,luwin,Good.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,bran stark,Hodor.
